//A nested class is a class that is defined within another class. A nested class that IS NOT
//STATIC is called an INNER CLASS. There are four of types of nested classes:
//
//■ A member inner class is a class defined at the same level as instance variables. It is not
//static. Often, this is just referred to as an inner class without explicitly saying the type.
//■ A local inner class is defined within a method.
//■ An anonymous inner class is a special case of a local inner class that does not have a
//name.
//■ A static nested class is a static class that is defined at the same level as static
//variables.
